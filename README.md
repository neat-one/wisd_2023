# wisd_2023

This repository holds the Jupyter Notebook for the WISD 2023 competition. I have also included a python file of that notebook for ease of use, but is best viewed in a notebook to view the explanations and visualizations in the notebook. The necessary packages and versions are in the requirements.txt file and all data is from the data given to me by the WISD group.
